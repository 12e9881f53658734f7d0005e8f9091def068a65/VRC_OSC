My osc thigns i hate github so much like why is there no update status bar, why does the update take 10 mins, 
I JUST NEED TO CLSOE GITHUB but noooo why would i be able to close github I DIDNT EVEN TELL IT TO UPDATE you would think something made for developers would be yk 
like really well working BUT NO like i need to make commits invisible but i cant do that either I JUST NEED TO REMOVE COMMITS AND I JUST NEED TO ADD A LOCAL FOLDER 
WHY IS THAT SO IMPOSSIBLE I CANT WITH GITHUB and yk what of course on top of all of that now it says authenticqation required. SO LET ME AUTHENTICATE MY GOD
thanks for making the limit 350 characters. man do i sure love github,.
